# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. The application is built using Python and several machine learning libraries. It employs an XGBoost model and is deployed using a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline involving Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Minikube, and Streamlit.

## Introduction

The Diamond Price Prediction application allows users to predict the price of a diamond based on specific features. Users input these features through a Streamlit web interface, and the application outputs the predicted price.

## Features

- Predict diamond prices based on carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, length, width, and depth.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- Real-time predictions using a pre-trained RandomForestRegressor model.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, Joblib
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, Ansible
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Minikube (Kubernetes)
- **Deployment:** Minikube

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Minikube
- Jenkins
- Ansible

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diamond-price-prediction.git
   cd diamond-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Docker:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t diamond-price-prediction:latest .
   ```

4. **Deploy with Minikube:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f Deployment.yml
   kubectl apply -f Service.yml
   minikube service diamond-prediction-service
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application:**

   Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Enter Diamond Features:**

   Use the sidebar to input the features of the diamond.

3. **Get Price Prediction:**

   Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted price displayed on the main screen.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- **Code Integration:** Code is pushed to the repository, triggering Jenkins to run tests.
- **Build Process:** The application is built using Docker to ensure a consistent environment.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

- **Deployment Automation:** Jenkins deploys the application to a Minikube cluster using Ansible.
- **Application Launch:** The deployed application is accessible via a web interface.

## Model Evaluation

The RandomForestRegressor model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **R²:** Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.
- **Adjusted R²:** Adjusted version of R² that accounts for the number of predictors in the model.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
